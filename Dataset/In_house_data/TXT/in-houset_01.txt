Non-contrast scan: Diffuse patchy areas of prolonged T1 and T2 signal are observed in the right frontal, temporal, and insular lobes, with poorly defined boundaries, measuring approximately 41 × 60 × 38 mm. The right lateral ventricle is slightly compressed and deformed, the midline structures are slightly shifted to the left, and the right frontal-temporal sulci are partially obscured. Contrast-enhanced scan: No significant enhancement is observed in the right frontal lesion. The sella turcica is not enlarged, the pituitary gland shows homogeneous signal, and no swelling is seen in the scalp soft tissue.
